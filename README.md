## 📖 About

**What is The Architect of Worlds?**  
The Architect of Worlds is an interactive 3D WebGL portfolio experience built with Next.js, React Three Fiber, Three.js, and TypeScript. It presents a set of handcrafted planets, animated space effects, UI overlays, and an alternate Galactic Garden view inside a full-screen browser scene.

**Why was it built?**  
It was built to explore how a portfolio can feel more like a navigable world than a conventional page. The project uses real-time WebGL rendering, shader-based materials, camera transitions, and browser audio instead of pre-rendered video or plugins.

**What inspired it?**  
The project is influenced by deep-space exploration, science-fiction interface design, ambient game menus, NASA-style cosmic visualizations, and polished product-presentation pacing. These references shaped the tone, camera motion, celestial subjects, and layered HUD design.

**What experience does it create?**  
Users can move through a 3D universe, select planets from the navigator, inspect lore and telemetry panels, trigger world-specific interactions, open a Nova chat interface, and switch into a Galactic Garden portfolio mode.

---

## 💡 Inspiration

The project began with the idea of turning a personal portfolio into a small explorable cosmos, where each world could represent a different part of the creator's identity, technical background, or contact flow. Its visual direction reflects cinematic space imagery, science-fiction maps, and interface-heavy exploration games without trying to reproduce any single source.

Technically, it draws from the React Three Fiber and Three.js ecosystem: declarative scene composition, shader materials, post-processing, OrbitControls, and animated camera movement. The UI pacing is also influenced by product demos and cinematic onboarding sequences, where transitions and framing help guide attention.

---

## 🧩 Challenges

- Building a full-screen React Three Fiber scene that can coexist with layered React UI, modals, HUD panels, and pointer-event boundaries.
- Balancing visual detail with browser performance through dynamic quality tiers, reduced post-processing on low-tier devices, and point/instanced rendering patterns.
- Coordinating GSAP camera transitions with user-driven OrbitControls and global Zustand state.
- Keeping Nova's AI chat contextual to the currently selected object while routing requests through a server API.
- Designing the Galactic Garden as a separate view mode without duplicating the entire application shell.
- Organizing reusable world, environment, shader, audio, and UI components as the project grew.

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- React Three Fiber works best here when scene responsibilities are split into focused components: camera, environment, worlds, effects, and UI-facing state.
- Shader-driven materials and emissive lighting can carry much of the visual identity without relying on large media files.
- Camera movement needs explicit state coordination; transitions, selected worlds, selected objects, and free navigation all compete for control.
- Browser audio should be initialized from user flow and kept adjustable through shared state.
- AI integration feels more coherent when the prompt includes local scene context instead of treating the assistant as a detached chat widget.
- Performance work is not a final pass; it shapes component boundaries, quality settings, rendering counts, and when effects are mounted.

## 🚀 Features

🟡 **Cinematic Intro / Loading** - `LoadingScreen`, `IntroSequence`, and camera intro state are implemented, though the store currently starts with instant access enabled.  
✅ **Interactive Universe** - Full-screen React Three Fiber canvas with Drei `OrbitControls` for rotate, zoom, and pan navigation.  
✅ **Handcrafted Worlds** - Six primary worlds are configured and rendered: Nexus, Terra Earth, Forge, Ocean, Crystal Moon, and Singularity. A secret planet component also exists.  
✅ **Dynamic Camera** - `CinematicCamera` uses GSAP timelines to move between overview, worlds, and discovered objects.  
✅ **Particle and Space Effects** - Procedural background stars, drifting dust, floating rocks, comets, nebula effects, and anomalies are implemented.  
✅ **Custom Shaders** - GLSL shader strings and shader materials support planet, lava, ocean, crystal, energy, nebula, and singularity visuals.  
✅ **Nova AI** - The chat route streams responses through the Vercel AI SDK using an OpenAI-compatible provider and scene context.  
✅ **Planet Exploration UI** - World detail panels, discovery HUD, timeline-style UI, search, labels, and lore/telemetry data are present.  
🟡 **Responsive UI / Quality Tiers** - Tailwind UI, viewport settings, reduced-motion/device capability hooks, and lower quality rendering paths are present; additional mobile control polish remains in progress.  
✅ **Procedural Audio** - Web Audio oscillators, filtered noise, navigation chimes, mute/volume state, and world-specific synth tones are implemented.  
🟡 **World Interactions** - Interaction components exist for each main world; continued polish is still tracked in the roadmap.  
🟡 **Galactic Garden Mode** - A separate garden scene, plant species data, garden HUD, stats, labels, and modal UI are implemented; continued polish remains in progress.

## 🏛️ Architecture

* **App Router (`src/app`)**: Provides the root layout, global styles, error/loading/not-found states, the main page, and the `api/chat/route.ts` endpoint.
* **Scene Graph (`src/components/canvas/SceneContent.tsx`)**: Mounts the main Three.js scene, worlds, lighting, procedural background effects, post-processing, and the Galactic Garden view switch.
* **React Components (`src/components/ui`)**: DOM overlays layered over the canvas for navigation, HUDs, detail panels, chat, discovery logs, and toolbar controls.
* **State Management (`zustand`)**: Decouples selected worlds, selected objects, view mode, achievements, audio state, and UI flags from the WebGL canvas.
* **Three.js / Shaders (`src/shaders`)**: Reusable GLSL shader strings and materials for planetary surfaces, energy effects, nebulae, lava, ocean, crystal, and singularity visuals.
* **Nova API (`src/app/api/chat`)**: Uses the Vercel AI SDK to stream context-aware assistant responses from the server route.

## 🛤️ Project Walkthrough

1. **Landing**  
   The application mounts directly into a full-screen WebGL canvas. A loading overlay is displayed while the dynamically imported scene initializes.

2. **Universe Overview**  
   The camera frames a starfield, drifting dust, central Nexus, handcrafted worlds, and animated background elements. Users can rotate, pan, and zoom with OrbitControls.

3. **World Selection**  
   Using the **Grand World Navigator** top bar, the user selects a planet. The GSAP-controlled camera transitions toward the selected celestial body.

4. **Interaction & Deep Exploration**  
   Detail panels open with world-specific descriptions, metrics, discoveries, and interaction controls such as anvil, crystal, ruins, tree, constellation, and time-rewind concepts.

5. **Nova AI**  
   Opening Nova displays a conversational interface. The API route includes selected-object context so responses can reference the current world or object.

6. **Portfolio / Galactic Garden**  
   Entering Garden Mode switches from the universe scene to a stylized alien garden with plant species data, ecosystem stats, labels, and portfolio-oriented panels.

## ⚡ Performance

Rendering a multi-world WebGL scene in the browser requires active optimization. The following systems are implemented:

* **Dynamic Canvas Loading**: The main `SceneCanvas` is dynamically imported from the Next.js page.
* **Point and Instanced Rendering**: Stars, dust, and floating rocks use point buffers or instanced meshes to keep repeated geometry efficient.
* **Quality Tiers**: `useDeviceCapability` detects mobile or lower-end renderers and passes a quality tier into the canvas.
* **Effect Scaling**: Nebula, comet, and post-processing intensity are reduced or skipped on lower quality tiers.
* **DPR Control**: Canvas device pixel ratio is capped differently for high, medium, and low quality settings.
